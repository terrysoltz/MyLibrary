# MyLibrary
Revised example of code first, database driven application development, simulating some operations 
of a simple multi-branch library system. The application allows a user to view the available titles 
by branch, as well as the current books on loan. The user can then check out or return books and the 
application will update the database accordingly. The original application was rebuilt using .NET 
Identity Framework to allow for user login and Admin role, though no Admin functionality has been 
added yet
