        This application is a demonstration of code first development in Entity Framework. It simulates
        the simplified operation of a multi-branch municipal library system. The user can
        @Html.ActionLink("view books", "Index", "Copies", null, null) that ae available at the various
        branches, and check them out if their name is already in the system. Additionally, the user can
        @Html.ActionLink("view books", "Index", "Loans", null, null) that are currently on loan and check
        them back in. The number of copies of that book that are available is updated accordingly.
